### Quickly update an article using GitHub.com

Contributors who only make infrequent or small updates can edit the file directly on GitHub.com without having to install any additional software. This article shows you how. [This two-minute video](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE1XQTG) also covers how to contribute.

1. Make sure you're signed in to GitHub.com with your GitHub account.
2. Browse to the page you want to edit on Microsoft Learn.
3. On the right-hand side of the page, click **Edit** (pencil icon).

5. The topic opens in a line-numbered editing page where you can make changes to the file. Files in GitHub are written and edited using Markdown language. For help on using Markdown, see [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Select the **Preview changes** tab to view your changes as you go.

6. When you're finished making changes, go to the **Propose file change** section at the bottom of the page:

   - A brief title is required. By default, the title is the name of the file, but you can change it.
   - Optionally, you can enter more details in the **Add an optional extended description** box.

   When you're ready, click the green **Propose file change** button.

> [!NOTE]
> Your permissions in the repo determine what you see in the last several steps. People with no special privileges will see the **Propose file change** section and subsequent confirmation pages as described. People with permissions to create and approve their own pull requests will see a similar **Commit changes** section with extra options for creating a new branch and fewer confirmation pages.<br/><br/>The point is: click any green buttons that are presented to you until there are no more.

The writer identified in the metadata of the topic will be notified and will eventually review and approve your changes so the topic will be updated on Microsoft Learn. If there are questions or issues with the updates, the writer will contact you.
